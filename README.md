ðŸŽ¯ My First CodSoft Internship Task Completed!
ðŸ”¹ Project: To-Do List Application in Python

I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my first task as part of the CodSoft Internship Program â€” a To-Do List application built using Python.

ðŸ§  What I Learned:

âœ… File handling with JSON for persistent storage

âœ… Building a simple CLI user interface

âœ… CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

âœ… Logic building for task management

ðŸ’» Features of the App:

Add new tasks

View all tasks with status

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

Save/load tasks automatically from a file

It was a great experience to sharpen my Python skills through real-world implementation. Looking forward to the next challenges! ðŸš€
