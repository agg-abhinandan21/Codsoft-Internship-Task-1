🚀 Project Completed: To-Do List Application using Python 🐍

I’ve developed a command-line To-Do List application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with features like:

✅ Add new tasks
📋 View all tasks with completion status
✔️ Mark tasks as completed
🗑️ Delete tasks
💾 Save & load tasks using a JSON file for persistence

This project strengthened my skills in:
🔹 File handling
🔹 JSON data structures
🔹 Control flow & user input
🔹 Basic CRUD operations in Python

💡 Built fully in Python to enhance task organization through a simple and effective interface!
